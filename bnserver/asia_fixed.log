Moral links:

    Marrying lung and tub
    Marrying either and bronc


Triangulating prime component with 2 members:
    asia, tub
This component is a clique of cost 4

Triangulating prime component with 2 members:
    either, xray
This component is a clique of cost 4

Triangulating prime component with 3 members:
    tub, lung, either
This component is a clique of cost 8

Triangulating prime component with 4 members:
    smoke, lung, bronc, either

    Using the best greedy heuristic for triangulation


Triangulating prime component with 3 members:
    bronc, either, dysp
This component is a clique of cost 8


Total cost of triangulation for all prime components is 40


Cliques:

Clique 6, 2 members, table size = 4:
    either, xray

Clique 5, 3 members, table size = 8:
    either, bronc, dysp

Clique 4, 3 members, table size = 8:
    either, bronc, lung

Clique 3, 3 members, table size = 8:
    bronc, lung, smoke

Clique 2, 3 members, table size = 8:
    either, lung, tub

Clique 1, 2 members, table size = 4:
    tub, asia

Total clique table size: 40


The junction forest:

Creating junction tree with clique 6 as root ...

Cliques 5 and 6 linked, separator has 1 member and table size = 2:
    either

Cliques 4 and 5 linked, separator has 2 members and table size = 4:
    either, bronc

Cliques 3 and 4 linked, separator has 2 members and table size = 4:
    bronc, lung

Cliques 2 and 4 linked, separator has 2 members and table size = 4:
    either, lung

Cliques 1 and 2 linked, separator has 1 member and table size = 2:
    tub


Assignment of potentials to cliques:

    Node asia assigned to clique 1
    Node tub assigned to clique 1
    Node smoke assigned to clique 3
    Node lung assigned to clique 3
    Node bronc assigned to clique 3
    Node either assigned to clique 2
    Node xray assigned to clique 6
    Node dysp assigned to clique 5


Checking conditional probability potentials:

    No errors found
